For this assignment I completed all the required functions please the bonus function. For every function that required to loop through the function a current = current.next was created in order to iterate over the list. Most of the checks in order to avoid point errors usually required a while != null statement in order to tell the loop to stop. 

Some of the functions required to keep track of two nodes such as remove by index where we had to keep track of the previous node before removing the required node. This is because the link would be broken if we didn't direct the previous next to the next of the removed node. I tested the functions in the main wish first a lablel of the function being test, then a test case where it function wuuld succeed and test cases where it would fail. I tried entering some negative and zero in order to test my functions did not throw an error.
